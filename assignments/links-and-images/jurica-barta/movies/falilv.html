  <p>
    "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a dark comedy film directed by Terry Gilliam, released in 1998.<br>
    The movie is based on the classic novel by Hunter S. Thompson and follows the drug-fueled journey of journalist Raoul Duke and his lawyer<br>
    Dr. Gonzo as they travel to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race and indulge in a variety of mind-altering substances.<br><br>

    The film stars Johnny Depp as Duke and Benicio del Toro as Gonzo, who deliver over-the-top and hilarious performances<br>
    that capture the outrageous and surreal nature of the story. The movie is known for its psychedelic visuals, trippy sound design,<br>
    and irreverent humor that skewers the excesses and contradictions of American culture.<br><br>
    
    "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a cult classic that has gained a devoted following over the years,<br>
    and is widely regarded as a masterpiece of gonzo filmmaking. The movie is a wild and anarchic ride that celebrates the spirit of<br>
    counterculture and rebellion, and remains as relevant today as it was when it was first released.
